# CoBAR_wind_sensing

## TODO 
- Read papers
## Questions to TA
- 

## Define our problem: 
- Scene: (wind) odor plume, odor source (ON/OFF), one fly, idÃ©e: plusieurs sources d'odeur et un vent
- Sensing: antenna aristae movement, 
- Motor control: like odor-based modulation but variation of odor due to wind

Plumes are currently virtual only -> need to apply mechanical transformation from plume to moving the aristae.

  ## Split work
(1) Person establishes wind-guided odor navigation environment / scenario

(2) Person implements aristae movements **ALINE**

(3) Person implements motor control of plume navigation with processed aristae inputs
